    - **Vegas Spread:** Enter as the home team's spread.
      - If Lakers are favored by 5.5, enter **+5.5**
      - If Lakers are a 5.5-point underdog, enter **-5.5**

    - **Total (O/U):** The Vegas over/under for the game (usually 210-235).
      High totals (230+) mean a fast-paced, high-scoring game is expected.

    - **Why it matters:** The model uses this to:
      - Adjust for blowout risk (large spreads = more garbage time)
      - Adjust for pace and scoring environment (total)
      - Set home/away bonuses for each player

    - **Don't have the lines?** Just skip this page.
      The model will use default (neutral) values.
