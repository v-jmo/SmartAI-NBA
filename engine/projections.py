#          the specific matchup.
# CONNECTS TO: data_manager.py (gets player data),
#              simulation.py (gets the adjusted projections)
# CONCEPTS COVERED: Matchup adjustments, pace adjustments,
#                   per-game rate calculations

    Build a complete stat projection for one player tonight.

    Adjusts their season averages based on:

    - Vegas total (high total = projected to be high-scoring game)
